What is a MongoDB arbiter?
Arbiters are mongod instances that are part of a replica set but do not hold data (i.e. do not provide data redundancy). They can, however, participate in elections. Arbiters have minimal resource requirements and do not require dedicated hardware.


What is the main purpose of the arbiter?
An important form of arbiter is used in asynchronous circuits to select the order of access to a shared resource among asynchronous requests. Its function is to prevent two operations from occurring at once when they should not.

Its necessary to have a arbiter in a replication for the below reasons:
Replication is more reliable if it has odd number of replica sets. Incase if there is even number of replica sets its better to add a arbiter in the replication.
Arbiters do not hold data in them and they are just to vote in election when there is any node failure.
Arbiter is a light weight process they do not consume much hardware resources.
Arbiters just exchange the user credentials data between the replica set which are encrypted.
Vote during elections,hearbeats and configureation data are not encrypted while communicating in between the replica sets.
It is better to run arbiter on a separate machine rather than along with any one of the replica set to retain high availability.
